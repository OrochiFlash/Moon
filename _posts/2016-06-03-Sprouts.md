So the site is coming along one feature at a time. Using Jekyll and Github Pages is turning out to be more of a joy than I had expected. I previously dreaded starting work on the website because I wasn't sure ifI could deal with the trouble shooting I'm used to when it comes to learning new tools. Not because I hate it, but because my personal life didn't afford me the mental bandwidth to handle that way of thinking. As things eased out towards the end of the week I worked on dissolving the mental barriers that had been keeping me from making the progress I had been dying to make. 

Also I started a garden in my backyard this past week, so that helped me embrace the idea of getting my hands dirty in order to create something beautiful. Even if the rewards of my labour weren't immediately apparent.
